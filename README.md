# flipcup
This project explores and models the game Flipcup defined by 3 parameters: number of checkpoints, rate of player 1, and rate of player 2. It investigates the probability of winning and the expected time of a game using several different methods which exploit the power of simulation and utilize Markov Chains to model the game. The final product both computes and visualizes chances of winning and expected time.
